# CALLING ALL PEDANTS

Inspired by [what-happens-when](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when) - more specifically, [Issue #49](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when/issues/49)

This repository is for:

* The curious
* The knowledgable-about-seemingly-useless-details-on-all-manner-of-subjects
* Real Wisenheimers
* Everyone

This will exist as a simple jekyll site for now, so

## Contributing

* The more details the better
* If you are submitting a new topic page, try and at least provide an initial Table of Contents and whatever details you have on the topic to get it started
* Topic pages will follow the format of OOOP (One and Only Original Post)
* If you would like to contribute but do not use Git or Github YOU CAN GIT OUT jk just email butwhatreallyhappens+gitout@gmail.com - put the topic in the subject line and we'll get you in where you fit in.

Let's have some fun LEARNING. Like Reading Rainbow except you do all the work and there is mostly reading and zero rainbows and a standing hard-pass from LeVar Burton RE: participation. ([Rainbow PRs](http://blog.annharter.com/2015/08/12/blinking-commits.html) welcome though)
