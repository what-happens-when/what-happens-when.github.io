### Follow-up ask: Milk

They'll say something like "These cookies are making me thirsty" - which is
meant to be a Seinfeld reference but it won't land right away. They will just
kind of look at you, expecting a response in the form of laughter, and
accompanied by milk because they really wanted milk but they didn't want to just
outright ask for fear of coming off a little gauche.

### Will Also Need A Straw

Something about teeth sensitivity and their last dentist visit and on
and on about how unique their fucking dental situation is. Total bullshit.

### Napkin - A 'Nice To Have'

Reaching back to childhood memories of being scolded for the errant crumb or
spot of spaghetti sauce, they will instinctively ask for a napkin. It's not
really their fault though. #issues

### Pure, Unadultered Vanity

The mouse will ask for the nearest mirror, at which point they will finally
notice what everyone else in the house had noticed days ago, but lacked the
heart to mention: Ears That Desperately Need Lowering.

### Toenail Clippers

That's just how mouse-types get their hair cut. Just... stop asking.

### A Broom Because: Of Course

Despite needing toenail clippers for only the dopest of fades, they are now
requesting a full size broom. Their disordered attention will not only have them
sweeping up your entire house, but also washing the floors. Honestly, you should
at least give the mouse at least one cookie just so you can see this part. It's
kind of incredible.

### Catching some Zs

I mean, if you can't even bring yourself to _think*_ about washing your damn floors
once in a while, imagine how tuckered out this mouse is right now. You'll need
to make up a bed with a blanket and a pillow. Don't even bother fluffing the
pillow - they're just going to sit there and fluff it as if it were the first
pillow ever created, and fluffing was a notion only for godly types that have yet
to send their only begotten sons with the Good News.

On the flip side, you can finally make use of that completely empty shoe box you
have in the closet that you still haven't thrown out even though you've been
asked like 20 times.

### Storytime

"It's like, when you're so tired that you can't fall asleep" - A Mouse, Having
Completed A Cleaning Frenzy, After A Haircut, And After Consuming A Cookie And Milk
(Through A Straw) In A Proper Way What Would Make Any MouseMother Proud

Find the shortest book possible, ideally one that is full of pictures so you
can just get past this next part.

### "I Really Think I'm Going To Quit My Job And Focus On My Art"

Almost immediately after seeing an image, the mouse will almost seize with an
imaginative wanderlust. They might already have loft listings pulled up and
opened in separate tabs. But first they are totally going to get their art thing
going again - renewed in inspiration. You will need paper and crayons. And the
ability to show great enthusiasm over something that is completely underwhelming.

### A Fountain Pen

Preferably. You can't really capture the emotion behind a proud signature with
some ballpoint Bic. What are you some kind of savage? This is art, and the
world will forevermore know its creator.

### Scotch Tape, Which You Will Have None Of

Because the next gift giving occasion is like months away. When you get back from
paying $4.35 for 2 feet of Scotch Tape at the CVS around the corner, the mouse
will stand back for an uncomfortable amount of time and admire their work.

### Isn't that so weird?

LOOKING AT THE FRIDGE REMINDED THE MOUSE THAT THEY WERE THIRSTY HAVING JUST HAD
A LONG NAP WHICH SURELY LEFT THEM PARCHED.

YOU KNOW WHAT FUCKING GOES GREAT WITH MILK? [[citation needed]]
